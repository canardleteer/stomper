Introduction
============

This is a simple client side implementation of STOMP protocol in python. The client 
is attempting to be transport layer neutral. The messages can be easily generated
and parsed, however its up to the user to do the sending and receiving.


stomper.py
==========

This module implements a series of functions to create the stomp messages. It 
also provides a function to unpack received message frames into a dictionary.
The Engine() class provides a simple state machine that can be used to respond
to messages passed to its react(...) member.


examples
========

The example receiver.py and sender.py use twisted as the transport layer however
other frameworks could be used instead. The examples demostrate the state machine
and message creation and parsing.
